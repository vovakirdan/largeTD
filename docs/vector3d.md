# Explanation
* **Vector Operations:** The `operator+` and `operator-` functions define vector addition and subtraction.
* **Dot Product:** The `dot` method calculates the dot product, which is a scalar.
* **Cross Product:** The `cross` method returns a new vector that is perpendicular to the two input vectors.
* **Magnitude:** The `magnitude` method computes the length of the vector.
* **Normalization:** The `normalize` method scales the vector to have a magnitude of 1.
* **Utility:** The `print` method displays the vector for easy debugging.
