# Explanation
* **Matrix Representation:** The `Matrix4x4` class uses a 2D array `m[4][4]` to represent the matrix elements.
* **Matrix Operations:** The class supports addition, subtraction, and multiplication of matrices, as well as multiplication by a 4D vector.
* **Transformation Matrices:** Static methods provide easy creation of translation, scaling, and rotation matrices.
* **Utility Methods:** The `print` method is used for debugging and viewing the matrix contents.
* **Minor Calculation:**

    * We calculate the minor for each element in the matrix. The minor is the determinant of the 3x3 matrix that results when the row and column of the current element are removed.
* **Determinant Calculation:**

    * The determinant is computed using the first row and its corresponding minors. This is the sum of each element in the first row multiplied by its minor, with alternating signs.
* **Matrix Inversion:**

    * For each element in the inverse matrix, we calculate the cofactor (minor with a sign) and then multiply by the inverse of the determinant. This process effectively handles the adjugate and transpose steps at once by directly assigning the value to the transposed position in the result matrix.

* **Field of View (FOV):** The `fov` parameter represents the vertical field of view in radians.
* **Aspect Ratio:** The `aspect` parameter is the ratio of the viewport's width to its height.
* **Near and Far Planes:** The `near` and `far` parameters represent the distances to the near and far clipping planes, respectively. Objects outside this range will not be rendered.
* **Orthographic Projection:** Unlike perspective projection, orthographic projection maintains parallel lines and does not provide a sense of depth. Itâ€™s useful for technical and architectural drawings.
    * Parameters:
        * `left`, `right`: Define the left and right planes of the viewing volume.
        * `bottom`, `top`: Define the bottom and top planes.
        * `near`, `far`: Define the near and far planes of the viewing volume.
