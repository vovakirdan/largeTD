# Explanation
1. Camera Positioning and Orientation:

* The `Camera` class keeps track of its position in the world (`position`), the point it's looking at (`target`), and the up direction (`up`), which defines the camera's orientation.
2. View Matrix:

* The `viewMatrix` is computed using the camera's position, target, and up vector. The `updateViewMatrix()` method recalculates this matrix whenever the camera's position or target changes.
3. Projection Matrix:

* The `projectionMatrix` can be set to either a perspective or orthographic projection, using the existing `Matrix4x4::perspective` and `Matrix4x4::orthographic` methods.
4. Moving and Orienting the Camera:

* The `moveTo()` and `lookAt()` methods allow repositioning the camera or changing its orientation. These methods automatically update the view matrix to reflect the changes.
