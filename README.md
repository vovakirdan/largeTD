# Large 3D renderer
## Overview
This project is a basic 3D renderer written from scratch in [language used]. It is designed to provide a fundamental understanding of how 3D rendering works by implementing core concepts such as vertex transformation, perspective projection, and rasterization. The renderer supports basic shapes, simple shading, and a single light source.

## Features
* **3D Model Loading:** Supports basic geometric shapes and custom models in [supported formats, if any].
* **Camera System:** Includes basic controls for translating and rotating the camera in 3D space.
* **Projection:** Implements a simple perspective projection to convert 3D coordinates to 2D screen space.
* **Shading:** Basic shading model using flat shading, with a single directional light source.
* **Rasterization:** Converts the projected 2D vertices into pixels on the screen.
## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

* `gcc`/`g++` is installed on your machine.
* ~~Graphics library, if any is no need is installed and properly configured.~~ Graphics library is right here!
* ~~Optional dependencies or libraries~~ no depences at all!
